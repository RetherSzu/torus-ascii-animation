# 3D Wireframe Animation of a Torus

This C program generates a 3D wireframe animation of a rotating torus (donut shape) using ASCII characters. It utilizes mathematical computations and ANSI escape sequences for terminal manipulation to create the animation.

## Execution

To execute the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RetherSzu/torus-ascii-animation.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd torus-ascii-animation
```

3. Compile the C program using a C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc -o torus torus.c -lm
```

4. Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./torus
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the parameters in the code to create different animations or change the appearance of the 3D wireframe torus according to your preferences.
